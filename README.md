Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering
Overview:
This project involves the development of a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The primary goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior and segment them into meaningful groups.

Kaggle Dataset:
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from Kaggle. It should contain relevant information about customers' purchase history, such as the types of products they purchase, the frequency of purchases, and other relevant features and Dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

Model Used:
The primary algorithm employed in this project is K-means clustering. K-means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into distinct groups based on their similarities. The number of clusters (k) is a parameter that you may need to experiment with to find the optimal segmentation.
